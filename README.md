## Visualization of New York Times Crossword Stats

### what's in this repo?
This repo contains a few ipython notebooks with cleaning, analysis, and visualization of my NYT crossword stats. I've been doing the crossword (more or less) regularly for years, but I've only been using the website solver (and stat tracker) since 2014. This gives an overview of my usage patterns (and the evolution of my solving times!) since then.

### getting the stats
These stats were pulled from the NYT website using the scraper found here: https://github.com/danderozier/nyt-crossword-stats-scraper. If you have a NYT crossword subscription, check it out -- you too can use this to get your own stats.
